# Contributing to TimeWeb
Hello! I want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible, whether by:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

# Installation (Linux)

Installation (Linux):
Prerequisites: git, python 3.9, and pip CLIs

1. Copy the repository on your local machine


```
git clone https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/TimeWeb
```

2. Go into the project directory

```
cd TimeWeb
```

3. Create a virtual envionment to handle project dependencies

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv timeweb_env
source timeweb_env/bin/activate
```

4. Install all project dependencies

```
cd timeweb
pip install -r requirements.txt (if you run into a psycopg2 issue: https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/1216#issuecomment-849321945)
```

5. Create the database

```
python manage.py migrate
```

6. Create a superuser

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

7. Start the server

```
python manage.py runserver
```

8. Go to http://localhost:8000/ and log in with your created user

Tips for development:
- Ensure your cache is updated if you modify a static file
- Run "python manage.py makemigrations;python manage.py migrate" if you change the fields in models.py

# Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (I use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)):

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request.

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that covers the project. Feel free to contact me if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/TimeWeb/issues)
I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/TimeWeb/issues/new)

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
