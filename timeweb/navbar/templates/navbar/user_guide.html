        Introduction
    </div>
    <p>
        TimeWeb's user guide intends to elaborate on its many features so you can more efficiently use and configure its user interface. Self-explanatory features that do not add to the user guide such as the settings are skipped. It's recommended to first create an assignment and take a look at its graph before reading this guide.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can still use TimeWeb without reading this guide. You are free to use the Table of Contents to refer to specific sections or read the FAQs at the bottom.
    </p>
    <div class="minor-category" id="what-is-timeweb">
        What is TimeWeb?
    </div>
    <p>
        TimeWeb is a time management application that visualizes, quantifies, and prioritizes each of your daily school or work assignments. Unlike typical planners, TimeWeb splits up and graphs all of your work until they are due. Every day, know what to do, when to do it, and how long it will take.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take a look at TimeWeb's <a href="{{ example }}">example account</a> to get an idea of what you should expect your assignments page to look like.
	</p>
    <div class="minor-category" id="open-sourced-and-free">
		Open sourced and free
	</div>
    <p>
		Not only have we chosen to make TimeWeb free, but also completely open sourced, meaning that anyone can access TimeWeb's <a href="https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/TimeWeb">source code</a> and host TimeWeb on their own machine.
    </p>
    <p>
        We want everyone to be able to access and benefit from TimeWeb without the privilege of money. No ads. No paywalls. Just you and your assignments â€” uninterrupted.

    <img src="{% static 'navbar/images/standard_assignment_form.webp' %}" alt="">
    <p>
		To create a complete assignment, you must enter these five standard inputs into the assignment form:
	</p>
    <p>
        <span class="minor-minor-category">
            Name of this Assignment
		</span>
        <br>
        The displayed name of this assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="minor-minor-category">
            Date Assigned
		</span>
        <br>
        The date this assignment was assigned or the date you'll start working on this assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don't remember, enter today's date instead. Dates from the future are also perfectly valid.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="minor-minor-category">
            Due Date
		</span>
        <br>
        The date this assignment is due.
    </p>
    <p>
        If this assignment doesn't have a due date, click the magic wand icon to let TimeWeb predict a due date for you. Upon submission, this due date will be calculated and estimated based on your other inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
		You can also enable soft due dates. Soft due dates are automatically incremented if you haven't finished this assignment by then.
    </p>
    <span class="label-question" id="when-should-i-set-an-assignment's-due-time">
        <span class="label-title">
            When should I set an assignment's due time?
		</span>
        <p>
            If you try to set an assignment's due time in the morning when you have school or work, TimeWeb will assign work past midnight as a side effect of having your work schedule span over that time. So, you usually should leave an assignment's due time at midnight.
        </p>
        <p>
            You should only set a due time other than midnight if you're going to stay awake past midnight for the assignment or if the assignment is explicitly due after your school or work such as at 11:59 PM.
		</p> 
        <p>
            For the same reason, there exists no default due time setting. The assignment form always defaults the due time to midnight to encourage users to set their assignments' due times at midnight. A default due time does not encourage this and may mislead users into setting their due times in the morning.
		</p>

            How long will this assignment take to complete

        <br>
        An estimation of how long you think this assignment will take to complete. You can switch from entering this input in minutes to hours if this assignment will take a longer time to complete.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's ok to be unsure about your estimate. However, if you cannot decide, you can click the magic wand icon to let TimeWeb predict a length of time for you. Upon submission, this length of time will be calculated and estimated based on your other inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="minor-minor-category">
            Minimum Daily Work Time

    <br>
    <img class="tall-image" src="{% static 'navbar/images/advanced_assignment_form.webp' %}" alt="">
    <p>
		Along with the assignment form's standard inputs, you can also enter enter optional advanced inputs to further customize your assignments:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="minor-minor-category">
            Name of each Unit of Work
		</span>
        <br>
        If you don't want to estimate how long this assignment will take to complete, you can split this assignment up into your own units of work instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if this assignment is reading a book, you can split up the book into chapters.
    </p>
    <span class="label-question" id="how-should-i-choose-my-own-unit-of-work">
        <span class="label-title">
            How should I choose my own unit of work?
		</span>
        <p>
            While this decision is mainly up to your own discretion, there are two general guidelines you should follow for entering this field:
		</p>
        <p>
            <b>
                1) Find a balance between being too small and too large in size.
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            If a unit of work is too small, it can become difficult to track your progress and estimate how long the entire task will take. For example, if this assignment is reading a book and it is split up into sentences, it will be difficult to estimate how many sentences are in the book, how long it will take to read the entire book, and how many you've read after reading.
		</p>
        <p>
            If a unit of work is too large, it can also become difficult to track your progress and estimate how long the entire task will take. For example, if the unit of work is "the entire assignment", it will be difficult to know where to start and how to enter your progress.
		</p>
        <p>
            A good unit of work should be something that can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. In the example of reading a book, a better unit of work could be splitting it up into chapters. This is large enough to make progress, but small enough to track it effectively.
		</p>
        <p>
            <b>
                2) If you are still unsure, don't enter your own unit of work.
            </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Leave this input blank and instead estimate how long this assignment will take to complete in the Standard inputs.

        <span class="label-title">
            Why doesn't my assignment's work for today respect its step size?
		</span>
        <p>
            As a reminder, the assignment form's <a href="#assignment-form-step-size">step size</a> defines how many units of work you will complete at a time, meaning you will always work in multiples of that number.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the total number of units of work in the assignment isn't a multiple of the step size, there will be a remainder of work you will need to complete that isn't a multiple of the step size. By design, this remainder of work is completed on the first working day of the assignment.
		</p>
        <p>
            For example, let's say your assignment is reading a book. If it has thirty-nine chapters total and its step size is five chapters at a time, you will complete the remainder of four chapters on the book's first working day.
		</p>
    </span>
    <div class="minor-category" id="assignment-priority">
		Assignment priority
    </div>
    <p>
        The assignment priority percentage quantifies how important an assignment's work for today is. Note that assignments due tomorrow or later today are manually given a priority percentage higher than every other assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
        You don't have to complete your assignments in order from highest priority to lowest priority. By default, TimeWeb sorts your assignments by Most Priority First. Change the Assignment Sorting drop-down to sort your assignments by Least Priority First, Most Work Today First, Least Work Today First, Soonest Due Date First, Tag Name A-Z, or Tag Name Z-A to suit your work style.
    </p>
    <span class="label-question" id="how-is-the-assignment-priority-percentage-calculated">
        <span class="label-title">
            How is the assignment priority percentage calculated?
		</span>
        <p>
            The more work for the assignment today and the closer its due date is to today, the higher the priority percentage. To further elaborate, every assignment's priority is first represented as a number, and then converted to a percentage by dividing it by the highest priority number of all assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
            If <code>x</code> represents the assignment's daily work for today in minutes and <code>y</code> represents the number of days between the due date and today, the exact calculation for the number is <code>sqrt(x)/(y - 1.8)</code> .
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>sqrt(x)</code> implies that as an assignment's work for today increases, it becomes more important at a lesser rate. <code>y - 1.8</code> implies that assignments due sooner are skewed towards a higher priority number.
        </p>
    </span>
    <div class="minor-category" id="assignment-tags">
		Assignment tags
    </div>
    <p>
        Assignment tags allow you to label your assignments under a broad category, such as subject, type, or your own custom group. You can order an assignment's tags by dragging them horizontally.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sort your assignments by Tag Name A-Z or Tag Name Z-A in the assignment sorting drop-down if you want to complete all of a specific tag's work at once. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Although assignment tags are only for you to see visually, the "Important" and "Not Important" tags are exceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Adding the "Important" tag overrides the assignment's priority percentage and moves it to the highest assignment list position. Though, note that assignments with this tag are still considered less important than assignments due tomorrow or later today and are therefore sorted below them.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, adding the "Not Important" tag overrides its priority percentage and moves it to the lowest appropriate list position.
    </p>
    <span class="label-question" id="how-can-i-control-the-tag-order-when-sorting-assignments-by-tag-name">
        <span class="label-title">
            How can I control the tag order when sorting assignments by tag name?
        </span>
        <p>
            When sorting assignments by Tag Name A-Z, numbers in tag names are sorted in ascending order. So, you can prefix your tags with the numbers 1-9.
        </p>
        <p>

		Click a complete assignment to open the assignment graph, a visualization of its entire work schedule.
    </p>
        The x-axis of the assignment graph represents days. The starting point at day zero corresponds to the assignment's assignment date, and the ending point corresponds to the assignment's due date.
    </p>
    <p>
        The y-axis of the assignment graph represents units of work, or how the assignment's work is split and divided up. As you progress through the assignment, you will gradually complete more and more units of work until the entire assignment is completely finished.
    </p>
    <p>
        The today line is drawn at the current date, indicating how much work you need to complete by tomorrow and how close the assignment is to its due date.
    </p>
    <p>
        The assignment's work schedule is formed by connecting the red points on the assignment graph, each of which corresponds to an increasing cumulative amount of work to complete every day until the assignment is due.

        <span class="label-title">
            Why isn't the assignment graph's today line always accurate?
		</span>
        <p>
            When close to the end of a day, the today line overlaps with the next day and could incorrectly indicate that the current date is tomorrow. So, the today line is manually positioned leftwards in this case to remove the visual overlap and clear up any possible ambiguity.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            If you're not finished with the assignment's work for today, use the assignment graph's "Enter Units Done" text box to input your own custom amount of work done. For example, if you won't complete any of an assignment's work for today, enter "0".
            <br>
            Click "Submit Work Input" to then submit your work input and "Delete Work Input" to delete your most recent work input.

        <li>
            If you forget to input past work done, on the next day, you can autoinput work done until today for every assignment. If you haven't followed your work schedules, autoinput no work done, and if you have, autoinput all work done.

            Why are assignments marked as finished for today after inputting no work done?
		</span>
        <p>
            By inputting less than an assignment's work for today, you imply that you're leaving today's work unfinished and you aren't going to work on the assignment for the rest of the day.

    <p>
		The assignment graph's curvature is completely optional for you to use, but it gives you control over your work schedule to better suit your work style.
    </p>
    <p>
        A more positive curvature produces a work schedule where you work more at the beginning and less at the end of the assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
        A more negative curvature produces a work schedule where you work less at the beginning and more at the end of the assignment.
    </p>
        A curvature of 0, or linear, produces a work schedule where you work an equal amount for every day of the assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Click "Set Curvature" and hover over the assignment graph to preview and trace its curvature with your mouse. Click the assignment graph to save, and click "Set Curvature" again to cancel.

            Dynamic mode
		</span>
        <br>
        By default, the assignment graph is set to dynamic mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        In dynamic mode, the work schedule and curvature automatically re-adjust. If you don't finish a day's work, the assignment graph will change to fit your work style and adapt to your past work inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
        As of v1.9.1, the exact implementation details of dynamic mode are incomplete and will therefore remain undocumented. That being said, dynamic mode discourages extremely low or high curvatures, tending to make the work schedule more linear as it readjusts as you enter more work inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don't like dynamic mode's new curvature after a work input, you can manually override it with the "Set Curvature" button.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="minor-minor-category">
            Fixed mode
		</span>
        <br>
        You can change from dynamic mode to fixed mode using the "Switch to Fixed Mode" button.
    <p>
		In fixed mode, your work inputs don't affect the work schedule. If you don't finish a day's work, you'll have to make it up on the next day. So, use fixed mode if you want the work schedule to remain constant throughout the assignment.

            Why do we ask for permission to view your grades on Google Classroom?
		</span>
        <p>
            TimeWeb must adhere to Google Classroom's regulations regarding third-party account access. This means that TimeWeb is restricted to requesting user data from a predefined set of permissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to <a href="https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/classroom/v1/cpp/latest/classgoogle__classroom__api_1_1ClassroomService_1_1SCOPES.html#ae389e7c46bab2c4c67f3e05c12db4e2a">Google's API reference</a>, the permissions for viewing course work are forcibly included with also viewing grades. Therefore, we must ask for permission to view grades, too, in order for TimeWeb to create assignments from your course work.
		</p>
        <p>
            As emphasized in TimeWeb's <a href="{% url 'privacy' %}">privacy policy</a>, we do not share any of your information with third parties. Nevertheless, you can always revoke TimeWeb's access by going to <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">Google's permissions page</a>.
		</p>
        <p>
            If you still want to use the Google Classroom integration without granting TimeWeb access to your grades, you will have to host your database and create your own Google Classroom API client. Please <a href="{% url 'contact_form' %}">contact us</a> for personal assistance through this process.

		If a Google Classroom assignment meets the following criteria, it will momentarily be added to the assignments page after viewing:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Its due date must be after today</li>
        <li>If it doesn't have a due date, its assignment date must be thirty days maximum before today</li>
        <li>Its assignment date must be before its due date</li>
        <li>Its class must not be archived</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Note that assignments on TimeWeb and Google Classroom are independent of each other. That is, modifications made to assignments on TimeWeb are not reflected on Google Classroom and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
        Google Classroom assignments are not re-added to the assignments page. If you want to recover a deleted Google Classroom assignment, you can restore it from the deleted assignments view in the settings.

    <span class="label-question" id="why-are-some-google-classroom-assignments-incorrectly-due-at-11:59-pm">
        <span class="label-title">
            Why are some Google Classroom assignments incorrectly due at 11:59 PM?
		</span>
        <p>
            Google Classroom assignments without a due time are not ideally defaulted to 12:00 AM but instead 11:59 PM, which could mislead you into thinking they are due later than they are. These assignments, however, are indistinguishable from those actually due at 11:59 PM, so TimeWeb must choose one of these two cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, TimeWeb keeps the due time at 11:59 PM and assumes the assignment is actually due at 11:59 PM because this case is usually more common. This is why Google Classroom assignments without a due time are also incorrectly kept at 11:59 PM.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can reverse this behavior by toggling on "Google Classroom 11:59 PM Due Time Fix" in the settings. TimeWeb will now assume the latter case and change Google Classroom assignment due times from 11:59 PM to 12:00 AM. Similarly to the first case, this means that Google Classroom assignments that are actually due at 11:59 PM will also have their due times changed to 12:00 AM.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that this setting's functionality doesn't apply to Google Classroom assignments that are due later today at 11:59 PM, are due on their assignment day, or have already been created.
