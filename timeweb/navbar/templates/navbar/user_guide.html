        <p>TimeWeb's user guide intends to elaborate on its many features so you can more efficiently use and configure its user interface. Self-explanatory features that do not add to the user guide such as the settings and assignment sortings are skipped. It's recommended to first create an assignment and take a look at its graph before reading this guide.</p>
        <p>You can still use TimeWeb without reading this guide. You are free to use the Table of Contents to refer to specific sections or read the FAQs at the bottom.</p>

        <p>TimeWeb is a time management application that visualizes, quantifies, and prioritizes each of your daily school or work assignments. Unlike typical planners, TimeWeb splits up and graphs all of your work until they are due. Every day, know what to do, when to do it, and how long it will take.</p>
        <p>Take a look at TimeWeb's <a href="{{ example }}">example account</a> to get an idea of what you should expect your homepage to look like.</p>

        <summary class="minor-category" id="open-sourced-and-free">Open sourced and free</summary>
        <p>We've chosen to make TimeWeb open source and free for all users, meaning that anyone can access the entirety of TimeWeb's <a href="https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/TimeWeb">source code</a> and even host TimeWeb on their own machine. We want everyone to be able to access and benefit from TimeWeb without the privilege of money. No ads. No paywalls. Just you and your assignments â€” uninterrupted.</p>

    <details open>
        <summary class="minor-category" id="standard-assignment-form-inputs">Standard inputs</summary>
        <p>To create a complete TimeWeb assignment, you must enter these five standard inputs into the assignment form:</p>
        <p>
            <span class="minor-minor-category">Name of this Assignment</span>
            <br>
            The displayed name of this assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="minor-minor-category">Date Assigned</span>
            <br>
            The date this assignment was assigned or the date you'll start working on this assignment. If you don't remember, enter today's date instead. Dates from the future are also perfectly valid. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="minor-minor-category">Due Date</span>
            <br>
            The date this assignment is due. If your assignment doesn't have a due date, click the magic wand icon to let TimeWeb predict a due date for you. Upon submission, this due date will be calculated and estimated based on your other inputs.
        </p>
        <p>You can also enable soft due dates. Soft due dates are automatically incremented if you haven't finished this assignment by then.</p>
        <span class="label-question" id="when-should-i-set-an-assignment's-due-time?">
            <span class="label-title">When should I set an assignment's due time?</span>
            <p>If you try to set an assignment's due time in the morning when you have school or work, TimeWeb will assign work past midnight as a side effect of having your work schedule more stretched out. So, most of the time, you should leave an assignment's due time at midnight. You should only set a due time other than midnight if you're going to stay awake past midnight for this assignment or if this assignment is explicitly due after your school or work such as at 11:59 PM.</p> 
            <p>For the same reason, there exists no default due time setting. The assignment form always defaults the due time to midnight to encourage users to set their assignments' due times at midnight. A default due time does not encourage this and may mislead users into setting their due times in the morning.</p>
        </span>
        <p>
            <span class="minor-minor-category">How long will this assignment take to complete</span>
            <br>
            An estimation of how long you think this assignment will take to complete. You can switch from entering this input in minutes to hours if this assignment will take a longer time to complete. It's ok if you are unsure about your estimate. However, if you cannot decide, you can click the magic wand icon to let TimeWeb predict a length of time for you. Upon submission, this length of time will be calculated and estimated based on your other inputs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="minor-minor-category">Minimum Daily Work Time</span>
            <br>
            An optional minimum amount of time you will work on this assignment for all of its working days. This input's default of 15 minutes can be changed in the settings.

        <summary class="minor-category" id="advanced-assignment-form-inputs">Advanced inputs</summary>
        <p>Along with the assignment form's standard inputs, you can also enter enter optional advanced inputs to further customize your TimeWeb assignments:</p>
        <p>
            <span class="minor-minor-category">Name of each Unit of Work</span>
            <br>
            If you don't want to estimate how long this assignment will take to complete, you can split this assignment up into your own units of work instead. For example, if this assignment is reading a book, you can split up the book into chapters.
        </p>
        <span class="label-question" id="how-should-i-choose-my-own-unit-of-work?">
            <span class="label-title">How should I choose my own unit of work?</span>
            <p>While this decision is mainly up to your own discretion, there are two general guidelines you should follow for entering this field:</p>
            <p>
                <b>1) Strike a balance between being too small and too large in size.</b>
            </p>
            <p>If a unit of work is too small, it can become difficult to track your progress and estimate how long the entire task will take. For example, if this assignment is reading a book and it is split up into sentences, it will be difficult to estimate how many sentences are in the book, how long it will take to read the entire book, and how many you've read after reading.</p>
            <p>If a unit of work is too large, it can also become difficult to track your progress and estimate how long the entire task will take. For example, if the unit of work is "the entire assignment", it will be difficult to know where to start and how to enter your progress.</p>
            <p>A good unit of work should be something that can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. In the example of reading a book, a better unit of work could be splitting it up into chapters. This is large enough to make progress, but small enough to track it effectively.</p>
            <p>
                <b>2) If you are still unsure, don't enter your own unit of work.</b>
            </p>
            <p>Leave this input blank and instead estimate how long this assignment will take to complete in the Standard inputs</p>
        </span>
        <p>
            <span class="minor-minor-category">Total number of [units] in this assignment</span>
            <br>
            The number of units of work in this assignment. If you have to estimate this number, it's ok if you are unsure. However, if you cannot decide, you can click the magic wand icon to let TimeWeb predict a number for you. Upon submission, this number will be calculated and estimated based on your other inputs.

        <p>
            <span class="minor-minor-category">How long does it take to complete each [unit]</span>
            <br>
            An estimation of how long you think each unit of work in this assignment will take to complete. It's ok if you are unsure about your estimate.

            <br>
            The number of units of work you've already completed in this assignment. This represents your initial work input and the first point on the blue line, so changing this number will vertically translate all of your other work inputs accordingly. If you have to estimate this number, it's ok if you are unsure.

            If you have entered a name for each unit of work:
            <br>
            This input is the number of units of work you will complete at a time, meaning you will always work in multiples of this number.

        <p>
            If you have not entered a name for each unit of work:
            <br>
            This input is the length of time that you will work in increments of, meaning you will always work in multiples of this number.
        </p>

        </picture>
        <p>The assignment header contains a brief summary of the assignment and its work for today.</p>
        <p>Above the assignment's name is its priority percentage relative to the other assignments. Below the assignment's name is the days left until it is due. Underneath both of these is the assignment's description, which only appears when the graph is open or when the assignment is marked as "needs more info".</p>
        <p>At the center of an assignment is its header message, which reflects the current status of the assignment. For example, if you need to work on an assignment for today, the header message will display how much you need to work for today according to the assignment graph.</p>
        <p>At the center of the assignment header is the assignment's tags. Tags allow you to label an assignment by a broader category, for example a school class period. You can also sort tags in the order you like by dragging them around horizontally. Note that it may be easier to pinch and zoom on mobile before dragging the tags around.</p>
        <p>At the right of the assignment header is the assignment's estimated completion time along with its finish, hide, edit, and delete buttons.</p>
        <span class="label-question" id="why-doesn't-my-assignment's-work-for-today-respect-the-step-size?">
            <span class="label-title">Why doesn't my assignment's work for today respect its step size?</span>
            <p>The assignment form's <a href="#assignment-form-step-size">step size</a> defines how many units of work you will complete at a time, meaning you will always work in multiples of this number. If the total number of units of work in the assignment isn't a multiple of the step size, there will be a remainder of work you will need to complete that isn't a multiple of the step size. By design, this remainder of work is completed on the first working day of the assignment.</p>
            <p>For example, if an assignment is a book that has thirty-nine chapters and is read five chapters at a time, the remainder of four chapters is completed on the book's first working day.</p>

        <summary class="minor-category" id="assignment-priority">Assignment priority</summary>
        <p>After you add multiple assignments, every assignment you're supposed to work on will automatically receive a priority percentage and a color. They both represent how urgent an assignment's work is for any given day compared to every other assignment.</p>
        <p>Their priority is also a factor in determining their assignment list positions, which represents the order you should complete every assignment's work, though you are still free to complete them in a different order. Assignments with low priorities will be positioned near the bottom of the assignment list, while assignments with high priorities will be positioned near the top of the assignment list, with the most important assignment always having 100% priority.</p>

        <summary class="minor-category" id="important-and-not-important-assignment-tags">"Important" and "Not Important" assignment tags</summary>
        <p>Although assignment tags are only for you to see visually, the "Important" and "Not Important" tags are two exceptions. Adding the "Important" tag moves the assignment to the highest appropriate list position while adding the "Not Important" tag moves the assignment to the lowest appropriate list position. Note that adding these won't necessarily always put them at the very top or the very bottom, as more urgent assignments may come first or less urgent assignments may come last.</p>

        <p>Its x-axis represents days, while its y-axis represents units of work.

            <span class="minor-minor-category">Enter Units Done</span>
            <br>
            This input is the text box used to enter an assignment's daily progress. Enter the number of units of work done on the graph's displayed date and click "Submit Units Done".
        </p>
        <p>For any day, if you've completed an assignment's work, enter the keywords "done" or "fin".</p>
        <p>If you haven't completed any of an assignment's work, enter "0" instead.</p>
        <p>If you don't remember how much work you did for your previous inputs, enter the keyword "since" followed by how much you've done since your last work input. For example, if you haven't entered any work inputs in a while for an assignment, but you've completed let's say 5 units of work since your last input, enter "since 5".</p>
        <span class="label-question" id="why-are-assignments-marked-as-finished-for-today-after-inputting-no-work-done">
            <span class="label-title">Why are assignments marked as finished for today after inputting no work done?</span>
            <p>By entering no work done, you're implying that you haven't done any work for that assignment and are not going to for the rest of the day.</p>
            <p>This functionality isn't exclusive to inputting no work done only, this also occurs when you input less work than the assignment's daily work.</p>

        <summary class="minor-category" id="advanced-assignment-graph-controls">Advanced controls</summary>
        <p>The advanced controls are completely optional to use but provide better control of your work schedule. Before getting to the advanced controls, you must first understand what the curvature is. The curvature controls the curvature of the graph and, in turn, your work schedule.</p>
        <p>
            A more positive curvature yields a work schedule in which you work more at the beginning and less at the end of an assignment.
            <br>
            A more negative curvature yields a work schedule in which you work less at the beginning and more at the end of an assignment.
            <br>
            A curvature of 0, or linear, yields a work schedule in which you work an equal amount for every day of an assignment.
        </p>
        <p>There are 3 advanced controls for the assignment graph:</p>
        <p>
            <span class="minor-minor-category">Set Curvature</span>
            <br>
            This button allows you to be able to hover over the graph to manually set your curvature. Click the graph to save, and click this button again to cancel.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="minor-minor-category">Enter Curvature</span>
            <br>
            This input allows you to manually enter a numeric curvature value. The graph is updated by this value in real-time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="minor-minor-category">Switch to Fixed/Dynamic mode</span>
            <br>
            This button switches the graph to fixed mode or dynamic mode.
        </p>
        <p>In fixed mode, the work schedule isn't affected by work inputs throughout the entire assignment. If you don't finish a day's work, you'll have to make it up on the next day.</p>
        <p>In dynamic mode, the work schedule and curvature automatically re-adjust themselves after every work input to adapt to your work schedule. If you don't finish a day's work, the graph will change to fit your work style. The curvature can still be manually overridden. Note that dynamic mode discourages extremely low or high curvatures, as it tends to make your work schedule more linear as you enter more work inputs.</p>
        <span class="label-question" id="why-do-similar-skew-ratio-values-result-in-different-work-distributions-in-dynamic-mode">
            <span class="label-title">Why do similar curvature values result in different work distributions in dynamic mode?</span>
            The assignment graph's <a href="#advanced-assignment-graph-controls">curvature</a> is ... etc

            Unfortunately, this is a side effect of dynamic mode's implementation, occasionally occurring after submitting and deleting work inputs. Try to re-adjust the curvature to its original state if this happens.

        <p>Google Classroom assignments are added right after viewing the main page. If a Google Classroom assignment meets the following criteria, the page will be refreshed with the added assignment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The assignment can't have already been added in the past (this can be bypassed in the settings)</li>
            <li>If the assignment doesn't have a due date, its assignment date must be at max 60 days before today</li>
            <li>If the assignment has a due date, the assignment can't have already been due</li>
            <li>If the assignment has a due date, its assigned date must be before its due date</li>
            <li>You must be a student of the assignment's class</li>
            <li>The assignment's class can't be archived</li>
        </ul>

            <span class="label-title">Why are some Google Classroom assignments incorrectly due at 11:59 PM?</span>
            <p>Google Classroom defaults assignments without a due time to 11:59 PM. This, however, isn't distinguishable from assignments with a manually assigned due time of 11:59 PM. </p>
