        Welcome to TimeWeb's official user guide! Reading this isn't required, but doing so will clear up any confusion you may have and greatly help with your user experience. It's recommended to create at least one assignment and take a look at its graph to get a feel for TimeWeb's user interface before getting started with this guide.

        <summary class="minor-category" id="what-is-timeweb">What is TimeWeb?</summary>
        TimeWeb is a time management web app that prioritizes, sorts, and lists each of your daily school or work assignments. Unlike an ordinary planner, TimeWeb splits up and graphs each of your assignments' work until it is due so, every day, you know what to do, when to do it, and how long it will take.
        
        TimeWeb was designed with a main focus on customizability and convenience. As we'll get to later on in this guide, TimeWeb supports many advanced parameters and options that can be configured for you and your work style.

        Take a look at TimeWeb's <a href="/example">example account</a> to get an idea of what you should expect your homepage to look like.

        <img src={% static 'images/assignment-form.png' %} width="550">
        The assignment form is used to either create a new assignment, which can be done by clicking the "New Assignment" button at the left of the header, or edit an already existing assignment, which can be done by clicking its edit button.
        
        The assignment form has 12 inputs in total. 6 of these inputs are required for a complete assignment, and 6 of these inputs are optional.
        
    </details>
    <details open>
        <summary class="minor-category" id="needs-more-info">"Needs more Info"</summary>
        You can still create an assignment without the required inputs, but its graph won't be usable and it will be marked as "needs more info". You will need to edit the assignment and re-enter its required inputs to make it a complete assignment.
        
        One use of this feature is for assignments you don't want to have a graph for, such as assignments due tomorrow or assignments that take a short time to complete.
        
        If you don't have time to enter a complete assignment, another use of this feature is to remind yourself to enter the required inputs later.
        
    </details>
    <details open>
        <summary class="minor-category" id="standard-assignment-form-inputs">Standard inputs</summary>
        These inputs in the assignment form are mandatory for every assignment. There are 6 standard inputs:

        <span class="minor-minor-category">Name of this Assignment</span>
        Simply the name of the assignment. is displayed at the left of the assignment header.

        <span class="minor-minor-category">Date Assigned</span>
        This input is the date the assignment was assigned or the date you'll start working on the assignment. Dates from the future are also perfectly valid. If you don't remember, enter today's date instead.

        <span class="minor-minor-category">Due Date</span>
        This input is the date the assignment is due. This can't be on or before the "Date Assigned" field. If your assignment doesn't have a due date, leave this input empty, and a rough due date will be calculated based on your other inputs. This should be a last resort, as the predicted due date may not always be suitable.

        <span class="minor-minor-category">Name of each Unit of Work</span>
        This input is how the assignment is split and divided up. As an analogy, if the assignment is reading a book, then this input would be "Page". In simpler terms, the assignment's header message will say "Complete [some number] amount of [this input] today".

        Try not to choose large divisions of work for this input. To demonstrate what I mean by this, pretend you're assigned an assignment with three worksheets, each containing thirty pages of work. Rather than entering "Worksheet" for this input, it's usually more ideal to enter "Page" instead. This way, if you complete let's say fifteen pages, you can input you completed 15 pages, which is nice and clean, instead of 0.5 worksheets, which is an ugly decimal. However, the latter is still completely valid if you prefer to input that.
        
        If you don't know how to split and divide up the assignment, enter the special keywords "Minute" or "Hour" for this input. By doing this, you effectively divide the assignment up into units of time, which is usually easier to estimate. Typically, you'll want to use "Minute" for working in short, precise intervals of a singular minute, and you'll want to use "Hour" for working in longer, less precise intervals of 60 minutes.

        <span class="minor-minor-category">Total number of Units in this Assignment</span>
        This input is the number of units of work in the assignment. The "Unit" part of this input is replaced in the assignment form with the name of each unit of work. This number will be split up over the days the assignment is due.

        <span class="minor-minor-category">Estimated number of Minutes to complete each Unit</span>
        This input is the estimated number of minutes to complete each unit in the assignment. The "Unit" part of this input is replaced in the assignment form with the name of each unit of work. Note that this value is logically locked to 1 when the name of each unit of work is "Minute" and 60 when the name of each unit of work is "Hour".
        
    </details>
    <details open>
        <summary class="minor-category" id="advanced-assignment-form-inputs">Advanced inputs</summary>
        These inputs in the assignment form are optional for every assignment, but they further enhance your assignments' work schedules. There are 6 advanced inputs:

        <span class="minor-minor-category">Soft</span>
        This option enables soft due dates. Soft due dates are automatically incremented if you haven't finished the assignment by then.

        <span class="minor-minor-category">Assignment Description</span>
        This input is the description of the assignment, shown below the assignment name when the assignment is open or when the assignment needs more info.

        <span class="minor-minor-category">Total number of Units already Completed</span>
        This input is the number of units of work you've already completed in the assignment. The "Unit" part of this input is replaced in the assignment form with the name of each unit of work. Since this represents the first point on the blue line and the initial work input, if you edit this value, all of your other work inputs are vertically translated accordingly.

        <span class="minor-minor-category">Step Size</span>
        This input is the number of units of work you will complete at a time, meaning you will always work in multiples of this number. The "Unit" part of this input is replaced in the assignment form with the name of each unit of work. For example, if the assignment is reading a book, the name of each unit of work is "Page", and this input is 5, you will always work in multiples of 5 pages throughout the entire assignment.
        
        You can leave this input empty to disable it.

        <span class="minor-minor-category">Minimum Daily Work Time</span>
        This input is the minimum amount of time you will work on an assignment every day. This only applies to days when you DO work on the assignment and doesn't apply to days when you don't work.
        
        You can leave this input empty to disable it.

        <span class="minor-minor-category">Work Days</span>
        These inputs are the days of the week you will work on the assignment. Green days represent the days you will work, while red days represent the days you won't work.

    <div class="major-category">Assignment graph</div>
    <details open>
        <summary class="minor-category" id="what-is-the-assignment-graph">What is the assignment graph?</summary>
        <img id="assignment-graph-image">
        After creating an assignment, click it to open its graph. The graph provides a visualization of your assignment's entire work schedule. 
        
        Its x-axis represents days, while its y-axis represents units of work. Day zero of the graph represents the assignment's assignment date, while the last day of the graph represents the assignment's due date. Every days' work is plotted and connected in red to form your entire work schedule.

        As you progress through your assignment, there needs to be some way to measure your progress so it can be prioritized accordingly. So, you must input the amount of work you complete every day. This will be plotted and connected in blue to form your assignment's work inputs.
        
        The 6 controls under the graph, 3 standard and 3 advanced, allow you to customize and log your work schedule to ensure the assignment graph is tuned for you and your work style.
        
    </details>
    <details open>
        <summary class="minor-category" id="standard-assignment-graph-controls">Standard controls</summary>
        There are 3 standard controls for the assignment graph:

        <span class="minor-minor-category">Delete Work Input</span>
        This button deletes the most recent work input from the graph.

        <span class="minor-minor-category">Enter Units Done</span>
        This input is the textbox used to enter an assignment's daily progress. Enter the number of units of work done on the graph's displayed date and click "Submit Units Done".
        
        For any day, if you've completed an assignment's work, enter the keywords "done" or "fin".

        If you haven't completed any of an assignment's work, enter "0" instead.

        If you don't remember how much work you did for your previous inputs, enter the keyword "since" followed by how much you've done since your last work input. For example, if you haven't entered any work inputs in a while for an assignment, but you've completed let's say 5 units of work since your last input, enter "since 5".

        <span class="label-question" id="why-are-assignments-marked-as-finished-for-today-after-inputting-no-work-done">
            <span class="label-title">Why are assignments marked as finished for today after inputting no work done?</span>
            By entering no work done, you're implying that you haven't done any work for that assignment and are not going to for the rest of the day.

            This functionality isn't exclusive to inputting no work done only, this also occurs when you input less work than the assignment's daily work.
        </span>
        <span class="minor-minor-category">Submit Units Done</span>
        This button submits the value of the "Enter Units Done" textbox to the graph. Or, you can instead press enter in the textbox.

    </details>
    <details open>
        <summary class="minor-category" id="advanced-assignment-graph-controls">Advanced controls</summary>
        The advanced controls are completely optional to use but provide better control of your work schedule. Before getting to the advanced controls, you must first understand what the curvature is. The curvature controls the curvature of the graph and, in turn, your work schedule.
        
        A more positive curvature yields a work schedule in which you work more at the beginning and less at the end of an assignment.
        A more negative curvature yields a work schedule in which you work less at the beginning and more at the end of an assignment.
        A curvature of 0, or linear, yields a work schedule in which you work an equal amount for every day of an assignment.

        There are 3 advanced controls for the assignment graph:
        <span class="minor-minor-category">Set Curvature</span>
        This button allows you to be able to hover over the graph to manually set your curvature. Click the graph to save, and click this button again to cancel.

        In fixed mode, the work schedule isn't affected by work inputs throughout the entire assignment. If you don't finish a day's work, you'll have to make it up on the next day.

        In dynamic mode, the work schedule and curvature automatically re-adjust themselves after every work input to adapt to your work schedule. If you don't finish a day's work, the graph will change to fit your work style. The curvature can still be manually overridden. Note that dynamic mode discourages extremely low or high curvatures, as it tends to make your work schedule more linear as you enter more work inputs.
        <span class="label-question" id="why-do-similar-skew-ratio-values-result-in-different-work-distributions-in-dynamic-mode">
            <span class="label-title">Why do similar curvature values result in different work distributions in dynamic mode?</span>
            Unfortunately, this is a side effect of dynamic mode's implementation, occasionally occurring after submitting and deleting work inputs. Try to re-adjust the curvature to its original state if this happens.

    <details open>
        <summary class="minor-category" id="what-is-the-assignment-header">What is displayed on the assignment header?</summary>
        <img src="{% static 'images/assignment-header.png' %}">
        The assignment header contains a brief and daily summary of the assignment and its work for today.

        Above the assignment's name is its priority percentage relative to the other assignments. Below the assignment's name is the days left until it is due. Underneath both of these is the assignment's description, which only appears when the graph is open or when the assignment is marked as "needs more info".

        At the center of an assignment is its header message, which reflects the current status of the assignment. For example, if you need to work on an assignment for today, the header message will display how much you need to work for today according to the assignment graph.

        At the center of the assignment header is the assignment's tags. Tags allow you to label an assignment by a broader category, for example a school class period. You can also sort tags in the order you like by dragging them around horizontally. Note that it may be easier to pinch and zoom on mobile before dragging the tags around.

        At the right of the assignment header is the assignment's estimated completion time along with its finish, hide, edit, and delete buttons.

        <summary class="minor-category" id="assignment-priority">Assignment priority</summary>
        After you add multiple assignments, every assignment you're supposed to work on will automatically receive a priority percentage and a color. They both represent how urgent an assignment's work is for any given day compared to every other assignment.
        

        Their priority is also a factor in determining their assignment list positions, which represents the order you should complete every assignment's work, though you are still free to complete them in a different order. Assignments with low priorities will be positioned near the bottom of the assignment list, while assignments with high priorities will be positioned near the top of the assignment list, with the most important assignment always having 100% priority.

        <span class="label-question" id="why-do-some-assignments-with-low-priority-have-a-higher-list-position">
            <span class="label-title">Why do some assignments with low priority have a higher list position?</span>
            You may notice that an assignment with a low priority is sometimes placed above an assignment with a high priority. As mentioned right above, the order in which you should complete your assignments isn't determined by their priority, but rather their position in the assignment list. Although it may seem so at first, this isn't a bug or a glitch.<br>
            <br>
            If you look carefully, there will always be a reason why this is the case; other external factors may make an assignment more urgent than others. For instance, the assignment could be due tomorrow.<br>
            <br>
            Check out the <a href="#advanced-example">advanced example</a> for a better understanding of this functionality.
        </span>

        <span class="minor-minor-category">An advanced example</span>
        To demonstrate, let's go through the methodology of ordering every assignment in an example. I have manually labeled each assignment in the image with a number:

        <img src="{% static 'images/advanced-priority-example.png' %}">

        At a first glance, it may seem like the assignments are randomly prioritized. However, this is not the case: the assignments are actually optimally ordered.


        Assignment #1 has the "Important" tag, so it is placed as the first assignment.

        Assignment #2 also has the "Important" tag, but it has a lower priority than #1, so it is placed as the second assignment.
        
        Assignment #3 does not have the "Important" tag, so it is placed as the third assignment.

        Assignment #4 also does not have the "Important" tag, but it has a lower priority than #3, so it is placed as the fourth assignment.

        Assignment #5 has the "Not Important" tag, so it is placed as the fifth assignment.

        Assignment #6 also has the "Not Important" tag, but it has a lower priority than #5, so it is placed as the sixth assignment.


        At this point, you may be wondering why assignment #7 and assignment #8 are placed at the bottom. This is because assignments #1 through #6 are all due tomorrow, as indicated below their name. They are placed at the very top of the assignment list, as, logically, assignments due tomorrow are more urgent than assignments due later.

    </details>
    <details open>
        <summary class="minor-category" id="hide-assignment">Hide assignment</summary>
        <img src="{% static 'images/hide-assignment.png' %}">
        
        This button ignores the assignment's work from the total estimated completion time and removes the assignment's priority. The assignment also becomes translucent as a visual indicator of this action. However, the assignment's position will remain unchanged. The assignment is automatically un-hidden the day after.
    
        Use this if you want to temporarily ignore an assignment's work from the total estimated completion time, to see how the estimated completion time or other assignments' priorities will change.

        You can also use this when you're not sure whether or not you'll complete an assignment's work for any day. Enter 0 units done instead when you are sure you won't complete any of the assignment's work.

    </details>
    <details open>
        <summary class="minor-category" id="finish-assignment">Finish Assignment for Today</summary>
        <img src="{% static 'images/finish-assignment.png' %}">
        
        This button automatically submits a work input that completes an assignment's work for today.

        <summary class="minor-category" id="important-and-not-important-assignment-tags">"Important" and "Not Important" assignment tags</summary>
        Although assignment tags are only for you to see visually, the "Important" and "Not Important" tags are two exceptions. 
        
        Adding the "Important" tag moves the assignment to the highest appropriate list position while adding the "Not Important" tag moves the assignment to the lowest appropriate list position. Note that adding these won't necessarily always put them at the very top or the very bottom, as more urgent assignments may come first or less urgent assignments may come last.
    
    </details>
    <details open>
        <summary class="minor-category" id="sorting-assignment-tags">Sorting assignment tags</summary>
        Tags are initially added to the end of an assignment's tag list. So, you can sort the tags in the order you like by dragging it around horizontally. Note that it may be easier to pinch and zoom on mobile before dragging the tags around.

    <details open>
        <summary class="minor-category" id="autofill-work-done-assignment-shortcut">Autofill Work Done</summary>
        Every day, you have to enter a work input for every assignment so it can be prioritized accordingly. If you don't enter your past work inputs, the assignment displays a question mark. The assignment doesn't know how to prioritize itself because it doesn't know where your progress is currently at.
        
        Suppose you haven't yet entered past work inputs for many assignments at once. Without this shortcut, you would have to open every assignment, manually enter how many units of work you completed, and then close it, which takes time. This shortcut allows you to automatically autofill no work done or all work done for each of these assignments.
