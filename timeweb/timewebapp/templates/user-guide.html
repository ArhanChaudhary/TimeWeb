                Welcome! TimeWeb's user guide documents all of its features, quirks, and methodology. Reading this isn't required, but doing so will clear up confusion you may have and greatly help with your user experience. However, if you do decide to read this, it's recommended to create at least one assignment and take a look at its graph to get a feel for the user interface.

                In this user guide, important notes and FAQs are marked and labeled. FAQ labels are used for questions you may have, and note labels are used for advice and important edge cases. An example of an FAQ label:

                <span class="label-question" id="why-doesn't-the-internal-date-change-after-midnight">
                    <span class="label-title">Why doesn't the internal date change after midnight?</span>
                    This behavior isn't a bug nor a glitch, but is actually intentional. Changing the date at midnight will result in showing the work for the next day despite the current work day not being finished. So, the internal date only changes to the next at the hardcoded value of 4 AM.
                </span>
                The "Table of contents" section to the left shows the complete outline of this user guide, and the "Important labels" section just below that lists every note and FAQ in this guide. If you came here because you're confused about something specific, there's a good chance you'll find your answer in either of those sections.

                TimeWeb is a free, online time manager that prioritizes, sorts, and lists each of your daily school or work assignments. Unlike an ordinary planner, each of your assignments' work is split up and graphed over the days until they are due. Then, they are automatically prioritized so you will always know which assignment to do, when to do it, and how long it will take. TimeWeb's main focus is on customizability and convenience. As we'll get to later on in this guide, TimeWeb supports many advanced parameters that can be configured for you and your work style.

                A few extra things to help with TimeWeb's credibility:

                Review: The creator of the TimeWeb is a really nice guy. You hang out with him in discord and you will realize he is really passionate about web development and willingly to put as much effort as it takes to improve the user experience even if only a bit.

                Review: I haven't used it in a bit. It wasn't the easiest to use but it was very feature heavy so you could do a lot with it. It's like iPhone vs Android. iPhone is really intuitive and easy to use. Android let's you do so much more but its not as easy.

                Review: TimeWeb is a great way to get organized. As a junior in a very demanding high school, being on top of your work is critical. I was never great at using my planner and even when I did write down my homework, I could not tackle it efficiently. TimeWeb fixes all of this because it is easy to input my work and it is easy to understand all the different features it has to offer. It sorts, prioritizes, and graphs all my homework. The graph offers an easy to understand trend of how you should approach your work, and the sorting system is the best you can get. But the one thing that makes TimeWeb great is the fact that you have so many ways to control and change a range from the big and important info to the miniscule details. By using TimeWeb you never need to worry about stressing over assignments, procrastinating, and missing deadlines.

                Review: Timeweb is a great tool when utilized correctly. At first it takes time to get used to due to the inputs. It can get a bit tedious when transferring homework to Timeweb. Due to this, it should only be used for bigger pieces of work that take multiple days instead of one day. Once it becomes a part of your routine, it still is tedious but you start to notice the benefits of using Timeweb.

                The assignment form is what you'll use to input your assignments into TimeWeb. The assignment form is used either to create a new assignment, which can be done by clicking the "New Assignment" button at the left of the header, or to edit an existing assignment, which can be done by clicking the edit button on an already existing assignment. 
                
                The assignment form has 11 inputs in total, 4 of which are optional. Default form input values, which can be set in the settings, are accordingly set every time you make a new assignment, and they can be manually overridden.

                <summary class="minor-category" id="standard-assignment-form-inputs">Standard inputs</summary>
                These inputs in the assignment form are mandatory for every assignment. There are 7 standard inputs:

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Name of this Assignment</span>
                This input is simply the name of the assignment. This is always displayed at the left of the assignment header, and this is only used for you to differentiate one assignment from another.

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Date Assigned</span>
                This input is the date in which the assignment was assigned. Dates from the future are also perfectly valid. If you don't remember, enter today's date instead.

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Due Date</span>
                This input is the date in which the assignment is due. This can't be before the date assigned nor today. If your assignment doesn't have a due date, leave this input empty, and a rough due date will be calculated based on your other inputs. Note that leaving this empty should be a last resort, as the predicted due date may not always be suitable.

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Name of each Unit of Work</span>
                This input is how the assignment is split and divided up. As an analogy, if the assignment is reading a book, then this input would be "Page". In simpler terms, the assignment's header message will say "Complete X amount of [this input] today." 

                A useful tip is don't choose large divisions of work for this input. For example, pretend you're assigned three worksheets from school, each containing thirty pages. Rather than entering "Worksheet" in this input, it's usually ideal to enter "Page" instead. This way, if you complete let's say fifteen pages, you can input you completed "15 pages," which is nice and clean, instead of "0.5 worksheets," which is an ugly decimal. Note that the latter is still completely valid if you choose to prefer that.
                
                If you don't know how to split and divide up the assignment, enter the special keywords "Minute" or "Hour" in this input. By doing this, you effectively divide the assignment up into units of time, which is usually easier to estimate. Typically, you'll want to use "Minute" for working in short, precise intervals of a singular minute, and you'll want to use "Hour" for working in longer, less precise intervals of 60 minutes.

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Total number of Units in this Assignment</span>
                This input is the number of units of work in the assignment. The "Unit" part of this input is replaced in the assignment form with the name of each unit of work. This number will be split up over the days in which the assignment is due.

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Total number of Units already Completed</span>
                This input is the number of units of work you've already completed in the assignment. The "Unit" part of this input is replaced in the assignment form with the name of each unit of work. Since this represents the first point on the blue line and the initial work input, if you edit this value, all of your other work inputs are vertically translated accordingly.

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Estimated number of Minutes to complete each Unit</span>
                This input is the estimated number of minutes to complete each unit in the assignment. The "Unit" part of this input is replaced in the assignment form with the name of each unit of work. Note that this value is logically locked to 1 when the name of each unit of work is "Minute" and 60 when the name of each unit of work is "Hour."

                <summary class="minor-category" id="advanced-assignment-form-inputs">Advanced inputs</summary>
                These inputs in the assignment form are optional for every assignment, but they further enhance your assignments' work schedules. There are 4 advanced inputs:

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Assignment Description</span>
                This input is the description of the assignment, shown below the assignment name only when the assignment is open.

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Number of Units you will Complete at a Time</span>
                This input is the number of units of work you will complete at a time, meaning you will always work in multiples of this number. The "Unit" part of this input is replaced in the assignment form with the name of each unit of work. For example, if the assignment is reading a book, the name of each unit of work is "Page", and this input is 5, you will always work in a multiple of 5 pages throughout the entire assignment. You can leave this input empty to disable it.

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Minimum Daily Work Time in Minutes</span>
                This input is the minimum amount of time you will work on of an assignment every day. This doesn't apply for days in which you don't work on the assignment. You can leave this input empty to disable it.

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Break Days</span>
                This input is the days of the week in which you won't work on the assignment. Green days represent days in which you will work, and red days represent days in which you won't work.

                <summary class="minor-category" id="what-is-the-assignment-graph">What is the assignment graph?</summary>
                After creating an assignment, click it to open its assignment graph. The assignment graph provides a visualization of how your assignment's work schedule will look like as a line graph. The x-axis represents days, and the y-axis represents units of work. Day zero of the graph represents the assignment's assignment date, while the last day of the graph represents the assignment's due date. Every days' work is plotted and connected in red to form your entire work schedule.

                As you progress through your assignment, there needs to be some way to measure your progress so each assignment can be prioritized accordingly. So, you must input the amount of work you complete every day for every assignment. This will be plotted and connected in blue.
                
                The 9 controls under the graph allow you to customize and log your work schedule. The 6 standard and 3 advanced controls, explained below, ensure your graph is tuned for you and your work style.

                <summary class="minor-category" id="standard-assignment-graph-controls">Standard controls</summary>
                There are 6 standard controls for the assignment graph:

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Delete Work Input</span>
                This button deletes the most recent work input from your graph.

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Enter Units Done</span>
                This input is the textbox in which you will enter your daily progress. Enter the number of units of work done on the graph's displayed date and click "Submit Units Done". If you've completed an assignment's work for that day, enter the keyword "fin".

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Submit Units Done</span>
                This button submits the value of the "Enter Units Done" textbox to the graph. Pressing enter on "Enter Units Done" also submits a work input.

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Display in Text</span>
                This button displays the entire work schedule in text, showing how much work to do every day of the assignment. This hasn't yet been coded in. If someone sees me at school, yell at me to code this in.

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Ignore for Today only</span>
                This button ignores the assignment's work from the total estimated completion time. However, the assignment's position will remain unchanged. This is automatically unignored the day after.

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Next Assignment</span>
                This button closes the current assignment and opens the next assignment.

            </details>
            <details open>
                <summary class="minor-category" id="advanced-assignment-graph-controls">Advanced controls</summary>
                Before getting to the advanced controls, you must first understand what the skew ratio is. The skew ratio controls the curvature of the graph and, in turn, your work schedule.
                
                A positive skew ratio yields a schedule in which you work more at the beginning and less at the end of an assignment.
                A negative skew ratio yields a schedule in which you work less at the beginning and more at the end of an assignment.
                A skew ratio of 0 yields a linear schedule in which you work an equal amount for every day of an assignment.

                There are 3 advanced controls for the assignment graph:

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Set Skew Ratio using Graph</span>
                This button allows you to be able to hover over the graph to manually set your skew ratio. Click the graph to save, and click this button again to cancel. 

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Enter Skew Ratio</span>
                This input allows you to manually enter a numeric skew ratio value. The graph is updated by this value in real time.

                <span class="minor-minor-category">Switch to Fixed/Dynamic mode</span>
                This button switches the graph to fixed mode or dynamic mode.

                Fixed mode:
                The work schedule starts at the date the assignment was assigned and remains static (assuming the skew ratio doesn't change), meaning if you don't finish a day's work, you'll have to make it up on the next day.

                Dynamic mode:
                The work schedule readjusts and the skew ratio autotunes after every work input to adapt to your work schedule, meaning if you don't finish a day's work, the graph will change to fit your work style.
                
                It's important to note that skew ratio autotuning in dynamic mode isn't always accurate, as it may not always predict your ideal desired work schedule. Dynamic mode only guides you in general direction of your work style, and you are still in control of adjusting the autotuned skew ratio.
                
                <span class="label-note" id="skew-ratio-doesn't-always-yield-the-same-work-distribution-in-dynamic-mode">
                    <span class="label-title">Skew ratio doesn't always yield the same work distribution in dynamic mode</span>
                    After submitting and deleting work inputs in dynamic mode, you may notice that the same skew ratio value may yield different work distributions. This isn't a bug and is instead a quirk with dynamic mode.

            <summary class="major-category" id="assignment-priority">Assignment priority</summary>
            After you add multiple assignments, every assignment you're supposed to work on will automatically receive a priority percentage and a color. They both represent how urgent an assignment's work is for that day compared to every other assignment.
            
            Their priority also determines their assignment list position, which represents the order in which you should complete every assignment's work, though you are still free to complete them in a different order. Assignments with low priorities will be positioned near the bottom of the assignment list, while assignments with high priorities will be positioned near the top of the assignment list, with the most important assignment always having 100% priority.

            <span class="label-question" id="why-do-some-assignments-with-low-priority-have-a-higher-list-position">
                <span class="label-title">Why do some assignments with low priority have a higher list position?</span>
                You may notice that an assignment with a low priority is sometimes placed above an assignment with a high priority, meaning that you should complete the low priority assignment first. Although it may seem so at first, this isn't actually a bug.<br>
                <br>
                If you look carefully, the assignment with the low priority in this case is actually due tomorrow, while the assignment with the high priority isn't. TimeWeb is able to recognize and make exceptions for cases like these, as, ideally, you should always complete assignments that are due tomorrow first.

                    <span class="label-title">Why do I ask for permission to view your grades on Google Classroom?</span>
                    This isn't actually a problem on my end. According to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/classroom/v1/cpp/latest/classgoogle__classroom__api_1_1ClassroomService_1_1SCOPES.html">Google Classroom API documentation</a>, which contains every type of permission I can ask for, there isn't a single permission for just viewing your course work, and I'm forced to unintentionally ask to view grades. If you would like, you can inspect TimeWeb's <a href="https://github.com/ArhanChaudhary/TimeWeb/blob/master/timeweb/timewebapp/views.py">backend source code</a> to see I don't use your grades in any way.
