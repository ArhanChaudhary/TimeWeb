                Welcome! TimeWeb's user guide documents each of its features, quirks, and edge cases. Reading this isn't required, but doing so will clear up confusion you may have and greatly help with your user experience.
                
                In this user guide, important notes and specifc questions you may have are marked with a label. For example:

                <span class="label-question">
                    <span class="label-title">Why doesn't the internal date change after midnight?</span>
                    This behavior isn't a bug nor a glitch, but is actually intentional. Changing the date at midnight will result in showing the work for the next day despite the current work day not being finished. So, the internal date only changes to the next at the hardcoded value of 4 AM.
                </span>
                If you came here because you're confused about something specific, there's a good chance you'll find your answer in the tables to the right, which lists every note and question in this guide.
