    Hey there! My name is Arhan Chaudhary, a junior at Mission San Jose High School at the time of writing, and I am the sole creator of TimeWeb! Before I start, I'd like to personally thank some of my close friends for providing genuine emotional support:

    My journey creating TimeWeb began on October, 2019. I was an 8th grade student at middle school in Fremont, California. In my science class, my teacher played a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU">motivational video</a> about procrastination. I had seen the video before, in fact. It featured a simple graph of daily work to complete over time for an assignment. Though I found it entertaining, I didn't think much of it. However, after rewatching the video in class, I had an idea: what if you could code a similar graph system for your own work?
