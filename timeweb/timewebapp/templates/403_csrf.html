    var element = document.getElementById('back-link');

    // Provide a standard href to facilitate standard browser features such as 
    //  - Hover to see link
    //  - Right click and copy link
    //  - Right click and open in new tab
    element.setAttribute('href', document.referrer);

    // We can't let the browser use the above href for navigation. If it does, 
    // the browser will think that it is a regular link, and place the current 
    // page on the browser history, so that if the user clicks "back" again,
    // it'll actually return to this page. We need to perform a native back to
    // integrate properly into the browser's history behavior
    element.onclick = function() {
    history.back();
    return false;
    }
