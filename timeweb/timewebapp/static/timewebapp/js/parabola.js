    The purpose of this function is to calculate these seven variables:
    a
    b
    cutoff_transition_value
    cutoff_to_use_round
    return_y_cutoff
    return_0_cutoff


    This part calculates a, b, and skew_ratio

    Three points are defined, one of which is (0,0), to generate a and b variables such that the parabola passes through all three of them
    This works because there is a parabola that exists that passes through any three chosen points (with different x coordinates)
    Notice how the parabola passes through the origin, meaning it does not use a c variable
    If the start of the line is moved and doesn't pass through (0,0) anymore, translate the parabola back to the origin instead of using a c variable
    Once the a and b variables are calculated, the assignment is retranslated accordingly

    The second point is (x1,y1), where x1 is the amount of days and y1 is the amount of units

    If set skew ratio is enabled, the third point is (x2,y2). skew_ratio will also be redefined
    If set skew ratio isn't enabled, the third point is now (1,y1/x1 * skew_ratio)
    Here, a straight line is connected from (0,0) and (x1,y1) and then the output of f(1) of that straight line is multiplied by the skew ratio to get the y-coordinate of the first point

    This is the only way I could think of storing a third point in a similar manner, as any other form will make the default curvature inconsistent

PREFACE (explaining what the point of this algorithm is):

My original view of timeweb in its very early first draft was to simply make the red line 
fixed at (0,0). This naive design implementation allows cases like these to instantiate:
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/890505752064716811/991842831587094599/unknown.png

according to this you have to do 565 minutes on one day and then 115  minutes on the next,
which makes no sense at all because a curvature of 0 is supposed to be linear and
you're doing much more work on the first day than the second

my solution to that is dynamic mode: a toggleable mode of the graph that repositions the red line:
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/890505752064716811/991842965993558097/unknown.png

I initially made the red line change its start to the end of the blue line ONLY when a work 
input doesn't match the schedule (i.e. diverges from it)

so for example if you have to do 5 minutes of work on one day but you do none, the red line changes
but if you complete the exact amount of work you're supposed to then the red line doesn't change

this second implementation worked way better than the original one and shined when the assignment
had a curvature of 0

however, in the contrary case, it caused a bunch of chaos; say you have an assignment like 
this, nothing wrong with it yet
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/890505752064716811/991843194272763985/unknown.png

lets say you do nothing for the first 10 days
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/890505752064716811/991843262262415430/unknown.png

according to the graph, you're supposed to do 1 minute of work on the 10th day
but if you don't do that minute of work then as I said above what dynamic mode does
is change the red line to the end of the blue line

but then after it does that i think you can see where the problem is:
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/890505752064716811/991843395406413855/unknown.png

it's important to note that coidng wise everything so far is working exactly how i have told it to
but the nature of the low curvature makes it so that when it's readjusted you AGAIN 
don't do any more work for 10 more days, which is really unrealistic

a curvature of -1.327 isn't even that low yet in this case it's causing you to do nothing 
for the entire first half of the assignment

an even more absurd case:

note that the current version of timeweb doesn't always blindly set the red line start
to the end of the blue line, it does a bit more than that for more realism but the same ideas
still imply. for the purposes of understanding the algorithm, assume that this is always the case

the goal of the algorithm is to automatically edit the curvature in the most ideal way possible
in scenarios like these

    STEP 1: Weighted Least Squares Regression

    we can deduce a criteria for an ideal red line curvature to be one that retains the
    same shape of the best fit parabola curve through our prior work inputs â€” leading us
    to our first clue: regression

    A normal regression through the past work inputs doesn't always pass through the origin,
    something we assume to always be true, and this time we can't simply translate the regressed
    parabola to the origin because it then wouldn't be an accurate regression:  
    https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/890505752064716811/991846369247629322/unknown.png

    We need to get a bit more creative and utilize weighted least-squared regression; by applying
    some gigantic weight value to the two constant points at (0,0) and (days between due date and
    assignment date, total number of units in an assignment), we can get a very accurate
    approximation of the best regression parabola

    don't worry about the fact that a large weight doesn't cause the parabola to *exactly*
    pass through these points. The a and b values are converted to valid curvature values

    Note: I will refer to "days between due date and assignment date" as "x" and
    "total number of units in an assignment" as "y" from now on
    

    Here are the final results of the a and b values extracted from the new weighted least-squared
    regression algorithm:

        STEP 2: Transferring the curvature
        Our WLS algorithm generates a parabola form the origin to (x, y), but as it turns out
        the exact curvature from that parabola isn't always desired

        Let's elaborate on what is meant by that â€” let's say your graph looks like this (the
        blue line is your work inputs and the green line is the WLS regression):
        https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836818352160243722/991797882233565374/unknown.png

        Since this green line is pretty low, its curvature will be pretty decently negative

        If we directly apply this curvature to the start of the red line, we'll get something like this:
        https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/836818352160243722/991798348057149572/unknown.png
        literally bringing us back to square one

        Thankfully, the efforts put into WLS aren't in vain. Perhaps we can find a better way
        to transfer the WLS curvature to the red line...

        as a reminder, the red line needs only one more control point to create a
        complete parabola. What if we use (x-0.01, f(x-0.01)) on the green line as our 
        third point?

        the precise logic of translating the parabola and untranslating it is hard to wrap
        your head around, so I've created a desmos graph to clearly demonstrate how this works
        https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fxznq4cjka

        Notice the three points that form the red line (in this case colored purple) â€” the
        green point, the black point, and the red point right next to the black point
        (bit hard to see):

        STEP 3: Defining an autotune factor
        With only one work input, the regression algorithm is heavily skewed towards that one
        work input, resulting in nonsensical curvatures such as these:
        https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/834305828487561216/872673400257118228/Screen_Recording_2021-08-04_at_7.51.42_PM.mov

        We need some sort of way to make this algorithm less influential at the start and more
        influential at the end by defining an autotuning factor
        
        (which when closer to 0, will be more inclined to retain the original curvature value,
        and when closer 1, will be more inclined to change to the new curvature value)

        Defining such a factor is more simple that you think:
        autotune factor = number of work inputs / number of working days between the start of
        the red line and the due date

        forming a linear gradient that successfully mitigates this issue
        */

        // Math.min(..., 1) to make sure the autotune factor is never greater than 1 (this 
        // can happen with due times)
        var autotune_factor = Math.min(works_without_break_days.length / x1_from_blue_line_start, 1);

        /*
        STEP 4: Nullifying repeated iterations
        The algorithms to autotune the curvature and the start of the red line have an
        annoying deadlock â€” When the dynamic mode red line start is set, the curvature needs
        to be re-autotuned, but when curvature is re-autotuned, it may mess up the
        dynamic mode red line start

        the specifcs of setting the dynamic start aren't directly relevant to this algorithm.
        The key takeaway is the fact that I have to loop through and repeat these two functions
        many times:
        for (let i = 0; i < Assignment.AUTOTUNE_ITERATIONS; i++) {
            this.setDynamicStartIfInDynamicMode();
            this.autotuneSkewRatio();
        }
        this.setDynamicStartIfInDynamicMode();

        The problem with this is rerunning the autotuning algorithm is that it magnifies 
        the curvature by double dipping this algorithm

        for example if the autotune factor is 0.5, the new curvature is 30, the initial
        curvature is 0, and we want to iterate through the loop three times, then the
        new curvature values would go from: 15 => 22.5 => 25.25

        Note that the point of the iterating has to do with dynamic mode, not the autotuning
        (i.e. I'm forced to also iterate the autotuning algorithm as a side effect)

        if the autotune factor is 0.5 and the new curvature is 30 i would expect the new 
        autotuned skew ratio to be 15 but it is instead 25.25

        The goal of this step is to nerf the autotune factor such that 
        the new curvature after iterating will be the same value as if it has only ran one
        i.e. iterating it three times makes the autotuned curvature 15 instead of 25.25

        15 => 22.5 => 25.25 is an exponential decay sequence can be modeled by the equation:
        s - (s-i)(1-a)^n
        (with s being the autotuned curvature, i being the initial curvature,
        a being the autotune factor, and n being the iteration number)

        We can then formulate the following equality, with x being the new,
        adjusted autotune factor:
        s - (s-i)(1-x)^n = s - (s-i)(1-a)^1

        solving for x:
        -(s-i)(1-x)^n = -(s-i)(1-a)
        (1-x)^n =(1-a)
        1 - x = (1-a)^(1/n)
        x = 1 - (1-a)^(1/n)

        Let's run a test case for this step:
        if a is 0.5, s is 30, i is 0, and the total n is 3:
        30 - (30-0)(1-0.5)^1 = 15
        30 - (30-0)(1-0.5)^2 = 22.5
        30 - (30-0)(1-0.5)^3 = 25.25, very different from f(1)

        Using x as the new autotune factor:
        x = 1 - (1-a)^(1/n) = 1 - (1 - 0.5)^(1/3) = 0.20629

        30 - (30-0)(1-0.20629)^1 = 6.19
        30 - (30-0)(1-0.20629)^2 = 11.1
        30 - (30-0)(1-0.20629)^3 = 15 (success)

        /**
        STEP 6: Reflecting the entire parabola
        This step is simple but very contradictory â€” before we do any of the autotuning we
        need to reflect the entire autotuned curvature over y=x (i.e negating the curvature)

        While we do want to preserve the shape of the parabola formed by your past work inputs,
        we also want dynamic mode to be, well, dynamic (in that the curvature adapts to your
        work schedule)
        
        we want to ideally punish those who dont work by making an assignment more important and
        have a higher priority if they don't work on it

        and vice versa; we want to ideally reward those who do work by making an assignment
        less important and have a lower priority
        
        thus we can redefine our goal to be the mirror of the parabolic continuation steps 1-5 achieve
        testing shows that this doesn't have much impact on this algorithm's other primary goal of
        preserving the shape of the parabola from past work inputs

        remember, 2 - autotuned_skew_ratio reflects the curvature y = x and
        (1 - autotuned_skew_ratio) * autotune_factor skews it towards linear
